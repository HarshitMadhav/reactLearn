React native now supports androidx from versions 0.60 and above
It uses jetifier
In order to build project on androidx make sure that the library itself supports androidx if not, wait for the maintainers to update it for
androidx support.

---------> In the meantime, you can work around this by using the Jetifier.

If your RN project is configured to use AndroidX, but some of your deps are not (like react-native-gesture-handler) follow these steps:

Install Jetifier npm install --save-dev jetifier or yarn add -D jetifier
Edit your package.json and add a postinstall script: "postinstall": "npx jetify", like so:
"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npx jetify"
   ...
}    
Run npm install or yarn
At the end of install you should see something like:
$ npx jetify
Jetifier found N file(s) to forward-jetify. Using X workers...`. 
This means it's working. The project should compile fine now.
This way jetfier will "upgrade" all deps to use AndroidX. This step has to be repeated after each installation, hence the "postinstall" step.

-----------------------Example package.json after changes-----------

{
  "name": "AppName",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-native start",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "postinstall": "npx jetify"
  },
  
  
------------------------Make sure to run npm install everytime before running link command or before linking any library so that it can
be converted to androidx by jetify and after that it can be linked to the project.------
