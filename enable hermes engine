Edit your android/app/build.gradle file and make the change illustrated below:

  project.ext.react = [
      entryFile: "index.js",
-     enableHermes: false  // clean and rebuild if changing
+     enableHermes: true  // clean and rebuild if changing
  ]
  
  Next, if you've already built your app at least once, clean the build:

$ cd android && ./gradlew clean
That's it! You should now be able to develop and deploy your app as normal:

$ react-native run-android
