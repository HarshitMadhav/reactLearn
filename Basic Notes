In React components, code reuse is primarily achieved through composition rather than inheritance.
Read about the Components specs and lifecycle in React. RN comes from ReactJS, they have a lot of things in common and understanding things like componentDidMount() or componentWillMount() will help you. 

The Component Lifecycle
Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this lifecycle diagram as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for relatively rare use cases.

**Mounting**
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()

--The other unusual thing in this code example is <View><Text>Hello world!</Text></View>. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript
--What are Components?
A new Component. When you're building a React Native app, you'll be making new components a lot. Anything you see on the screen is some sort of component. A component can be pretty simple - the only thing that's required is a render function which returns some JSX to render.
