In oppo and oneplus devices custom font does not get proper width when fontWeight:'bold' is provided to text component

Workarounds are :

1-- apply fontFamily to the text component
<Text style = {{margin :10  ,marginTop : 2,color :'grey',fontFamily:'graphica' ,fontSize :14}}>
Got Signup Bonus
</Text>

2-- do something like this to the text component => set borderWidth:2 and borderColor:'transparent'

<Text style = {{margin :10  ,marginTop : 2,color :'grey',borderWidth:2, borderColor:'transparent' ,fontSize :14}}>
Paid for Order
</Text>


3-- provide width to the text component.

Width measures of Text components using a custom font are wrong
