Whenever we move from A screen to screen B and do some changes on screen B then that changes made on screen B dont update when we move
back to screen A. The web service dont get updated or the state dont update when we switch back to previous screen.

This is the code that can be used to update the state of every component when returning back to the previous screen.

How to use this.... Call this code in the screen on which you want to update the component states on returning back from some screen

componentDidMount() {

     this.getMoviesFromApiAsync()
     this.props.navigation.addListener('willFocus',this._handleStateChange);

    }
    
   _handleStateChange = state => {
   alert('hoho')
   this.getMoviesFromApiAsync()
 };
