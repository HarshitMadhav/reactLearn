For those who are using react-native version > 0.60 , 'rnpm' is deprecated and custom fonts will not work.

Now, in order to add custom font in react-native version > 0.60 you will have to :

1- Create a file named react-native.config.js in the root folder of your project.

2- add this in that new file

module.exports = {
project: {
    ios: {},
    android: {},
},
assets: ['./assets/fonts']
};
3- run react-native link command in the root project path.
then run react-native run-android command
